## Introduction


## Lab 1
Serves as an introduction to the *National Instruments* **LabVIEW** environment. Based on the National Instruments finite state machine tutorial, students are required to implement a simple vending machine.

## Lab 2
Using the myRIO-1900, students must initialize the on-board accelerometer. The accelerometer signals must be passed through an adjustable lowpass filter and used to compute the roll and pitch angles of the myRIO. These five signals are to be collected into uniform arrays for future use.
